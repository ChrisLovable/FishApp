          "Baardman can grow to about 10kg, but usually catches are much smaller.  Body colour varies from silver to blackish depending on its surroundings.  It has a noticeable tassel under the chin which distinguishes it from similar species such as kob.  It is a coastal species that inhabits shallow rocky and sandy areas.  Baardman often swims in shoals, coming close to shore at dawn and dusk.  Often caught from sandy beaches in calm water close to shore.  Feeds on shrimps, worms, sealice and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates.  It is usually targeted with bait such as bloodworms, prawns and sea lice.  Flesh is excellent.
